# Ortho AI

Welcome to Ortho AI! This repository contains code and data for training models to classify images.

## Downloading the Data

To get started, you'll need to download the classified images. You can download them from the following link:

[Download Classified Images](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5l0o6aqq98kfnxnjc5ndw/processed_images.zip?rlkey=n7eo7vvqcvmjes6mhljyt0amp&st=nkoh1yld&dl=0)

If you prefer to work with the full uncleaned data, you can download it from this link, but you will need to clean it yourself, its about 16k images:

## Updating Paths

Before training the models, make sure to update the paths in the IPython Notebook files. Open the notebook files and look for any references to data paths. Update them to point to the location where you have downloaded the data.

## Trained Models

If you're interested in using pre-trained models, you can check out this repository:
